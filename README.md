# Last-120-years-Summer-Olympic-Games-Data-Analysis
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical Olympic records from 1896 to 2025. Using Python and interactive visualizations, it uncovers long-term trends in athlete demographics, gender representation, and national dominance across the Summer and Winter Games.

# Key Areas of Analysis
The project typically focuses on the following data-driven insights:

Participation Trends: Tracking the growth of participating nations and athletes over thirteen decades.

Gender Evolution: Visualizing the shift from zero female participation in 1896 to modern-day gender parity.

Performance Metrics: Identifying the most successful countries and individual athletes using medal tallies and "all-time" rankings.

Biometric Correlations: Analyzing how physical attributes like Age, Height, and Weight impact success in specific sports
# Tools and Tech stack
Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for interactive dashboards.

Dataset Source: Often sourced from Kaggle (historically the 120-year dataset, now updated through recent games).
